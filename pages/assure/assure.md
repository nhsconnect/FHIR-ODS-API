The Assure section contains descriptions of approaches and suggestions for building APIs at the Assure stage.

Any API developed must go through an solution assurance process which will assure the API meets the highest level of quality, is clinically safe for use and provides the necessary security features to keep organisations safe. This can be achieved through the test phase of development that may include the use of test services, involving the wider healthcare community and enabling end to end testing through tooling and test environments.

Additional details on how an API can be assured will be provided in due course.
