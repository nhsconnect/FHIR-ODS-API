# Introduction #

[Michael's story](http://www.interopen.org/content/IO4%20-%20Proposed%20project%20(Michael's%20story).pdf) has been widely developed, clinical assured and demonstrated at the [INTEROPen summit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1ZKQjXAAxz-Arn9lKQXuwpmlv7kMoo_0jEmqgKQKOg/edit#). The following Scenarios, Features and User Stories attempt to describe how Care Connect FHIR resources could be used to support Michael's story. While each scenario can support a number of user stories, these are expressed in a far simpler form to a real world counterpart. Also, these examples refer to a solution that is underpinned with some form of interoperability requirement. The translation into user stories doesn't attempt to describe the sytems that would be required to support each definition. Currently, this page provides a simple association to a relevant profile that has been documentated within this implementation guide. If no hyperlink exists then the resource is currently beyond the immediate Care Connect scope.

The images have been taken from the [Interop Summit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwn8CEFskNi-anUzU3BQaWRoRlk/edit).

## Hospital Services - Discharge ##

{% include callout.html content="<b>Scenario:</b><br>'Michael is to be discharged from hospital, with a care plan, and Dr. Hospital prepares his discharge summary. Dr. Hospital reconciles and reviews Michael’s discharge medications and produces a reconciled list of discharge medications. This includes hospital managed medication, new medications commenced during the hospital admission, Michael’s own over-the-counter medication, ongoing medication from the GP or other sectors.' "%}

This example refers to the reconciliation being performed by the doctor. The stories reflect this scenario and don’t explore the other cases where the reconciliation is performed by a technician or a pharmacist.
