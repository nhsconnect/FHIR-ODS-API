## Client's Context ##

University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust provides services to some 1.9 million people living in Southampton and south Hampshire, plus specialist services such as neurosciences, cardiac services and children's intensive care to more than 3.7 million people in central southern England and the Channel Islands.

The Trust is also a major centre for teaching and research in association with the University of Southampton and partners including the Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust.

## Case Overview ##

This case study explores clinical responsibility for acting upon order test results.
A clinician would want to acknowledge that he has read the order results so that everyone involved in the patient’s care is aware that an action has been taken based on order results.

The order results are available to all those involved in a patient’s care, clearly marked with who ordered them, who currently has responsibility for them, who has looked at/ignored them and who has acknowledged them.
