## Case Studies

Case studies provide examples of how real world problems have been solved using FHIR API's. Following a process that shows how the project evolved from gathering business requirements through to the final creation of a solution, case studies offer insight and education from the experience of other trusts and service providers.

Case studies demonstrate the application of the [Engagement Process](/engage).The outline of this process can be seen in the following diagram.

The development of FHIR based API's relies on community engagement. Contributions can be made by contacting the Interoperability Team using the email address interoperabilityteam@nhs.net.

## Michael's Story

[Michael's story](http://www.interopen.org/content/IO4%20-%20Proposed%20project%20(Michael's%20story).pdf) has been widely developed, clinical assured and demonstrated at the [INTEROPen summit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1ZKQjXAAxz-Arn9lKQXuwpmlv7kMoo_0jEmqgKQKOg/edit#). This scenario offers a theoretical platform on which to explore how FHIR profiles may be mapped and a solution defined. While each scenario can support a number of user stories, these are expressed in a far simpler form to a real world counterpart. Also, these examples refer to a solution that is underpinned with some form of interoperability requirement. The translation into user stories doesn't attempt to describe the systems that would be required to support each definition. Currently, this page provides a simple association to a relevant profile that has been documented within this implementation guide.
