## Case Studies

Case studies provide examples of how real world problems have been solved using FHIR API's. Following a process that shows how the project evolved from gathering business requirements through to the final creation of a solution, case studies offer insight and education from the experience of other trusts and service providers.

Case studies demonstrate the application of the [Engagement Process](/engage).The outline of this process can be seen in the following diagram.

The development of FHIR based API's relies on community engagement. Contributions can be made by contacting the Interoperability Team using the email address interoperabilityteam@nhs.net.
