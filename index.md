# Introduction #

The FHIR&reg; ODS Lookup API has been developed by NHS Digital. The API aims to  better support the delivery of care by opening up information and data stored by the Organisation Data Service (ODS).

The vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within UK health and social care.


# Using this guide #

This guide has been created to support the adoption of the FHIR&reg; ODS Lookup API profiles and FHIR resources. As such the site is structured around stakeholders including API users, developers and architects, who have an interest in implementing the FHIR&reg; ODS Lookup API.
