## Purpose ##

The foundations capability cover the basic API requirements and prerequisites to utilise the FHIR&reg; ODS API.

{% include important.html content="In order to successfully make use of the FHIR&reg; ODS API, initially a level of pre-existing accredited Spine connectivity will be required along with some FHIR foundation API capabilities." %}

## Prerequisites ##

### FHIR ###

In order to be a compliant FHIR server, provider systems need to expose a valid FHIR [Conformance](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/conformance.html) profile.

Please also refer to [Development Guidance - FHIR API Guidance - Common API Guidance](development_fhir_api_guidance.html) for full details on the common FHIR API patterns.
