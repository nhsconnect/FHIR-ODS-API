## Cross Organisation Audit & Provenance ##

Consumer systems SHALL provided audit and provenance details in the HTTP authorization header as an oAuth bearer token (as outlined in [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749){:target="_blank"}) in the form of a JSON Web Token (JWT) as defined in [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519){:target="_blank"}.

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT) ###

Consumer system SHALL generate a new JWT for each API request.

| Claim | Priority | Description | Fixed Value | Dynamic Value | Specification / Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| iss | R | Client systems issuer URI | No | Yes | |
| sub | R | ID for the user on whose behalf this request is being made. Matches `requesting_practitioner.identifier.value` | No | Yes | |
| aud | R | Authorization server's `token_URL` | `https://authorize.fhir.nhs.uk/token` | No | |
| exp | R | Expiration time integer after which this authorization MUST be considered invalid. | `exp` | (now + 5 minutes) UTC time in seconds | |
| iat | R | The UTC time the JWT was created by the requesting system | `iat` | now UTC time in seconds | |
| reason_for_request | R | Purpose for which access is being requested | `directcare` | No | |
| requested_record | R | The FHIR patient resource being requested (i.e. NHS Number identifier details) | No | FHIR Patient<sup>1</sup> | Audit-Patient-1 [(Rendered)](https://fhir.nhs.uk/StructureDefinition/audit-patient-1) [(json)](Audit/StructureDefinitions/Audit-Patient-1.json) [(Example)](Audit/Examples/Patient.json) |
| requested_scopes | R | Data being requested | `patient/Observation.read` | No | |
| requesting_device | R | FHIR device resource making the request | No | FHIR Device<sup>1</sup> | Audit-Device-1 [(Rendered)](https://fhir.nhs.uk/StructureDefinition/audit-device-1) [(json)](Audit/StructureDefinitions/Audit-Device-1.json) [(Example)](Audit/Examples/Device.json) |
| requesting_organization | R | FHIR organisation resource making the request | No | FHIR Organization<sup>1</sup> | Audit-Organization-1 [(Rendered)](https://fhir.nhs.uk/StructureDefinition/audit-organization-1) [(json)](Audit/StructureDefinitions/Audit-Organization-1.json) [(Example)](Audit/Examples/Organization.json) |
| requesting_practitioner | R | FHIR practitioner resource making the request | No | FHIR Practitioner<sup>2</sup> | Audit-Practitioner-1 [(Rendered)](https://fhir.nhs.uk/StructureDefinition/audit-practitioner-1) [(json)](Audit/StructureDefinitions/Audit-Practitioner-1.json) [(Example - smartcard)](Audit/Examples/Practitioner1a.json) <br /> [(Example - non-smartcard)](Audit/Examples/Practitioner1b.json)|

<sup>1</sup> Minimal FHIR resource to include any relevant business identifier(s).

<sup>2</sup> To contain the practitioners SDS Role profile ID (taken from their SAML assertion, linked to their Smartcard session).
