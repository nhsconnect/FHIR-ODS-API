The FHIR&reg; ODS Lookup API has been developed by NHS Digital and provides a searchable national repository of NHS Organisation Reference Data.

The FHIR&reg; ODS Lookup API forms part of the ODS API Suite, further information relating to the ODS API Suite can be found at: <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/apis-for-the-organisation-data-service">NHS Digital website</a>.
